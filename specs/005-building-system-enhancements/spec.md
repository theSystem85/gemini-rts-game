# Feature Specification: Building System Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `005-building-system-enhancements`  
**Created**: 2025-11-05  
**Status**: Implemented (Retrospective Documentation)  
**Input**: User description: "Drag-and-drop building placement, blueprint mode, chain build mode, construction animations, and individual factory assembly points"

**Note**: This is a retrospective specification documenting an already-implemented feature for the Code for Battle RTS game.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Drag-and-Drop Build Mode (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want to drag building buttons from the sidebar directly onto the map, so that I can quickly place buildings without the extra click of selecting first and then placing.

**Why this priority**: Core UX improvement that streamlines the most common building workflow, significantly reducing clicks and improving build speed.

**Independent Test**: Drag a building button from sidebar onto map, verify blueprint appears immediately and building auto-places when construction completes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a building button in sidebar, **When** player clicks and starts dragging, **Then** building icon follows cursor during drag
2. **Given** dragging a building button, **When** cursor moves over map, **Then** placement overlay appears showing building footprint and validity (green/red)
3. **Given** placement overlay is shown, **When** player releases mouse button on valid location, **Then** blueprint mode (BPM) activates at that location
4. **Given** blueprint is placed, **When** displayed on map, **Then** blue overlay with building name text appears at blueprint location
5. **Given** construction completes, **When** building finishes, **Then** building automatically places at blueprint location and blueprint disappears
6. **Given** blueprint placement fails (invalid location), **When** releasing on blocked tiles, **Then** no blueprint is created and building remains in sidebar queue
7. **Given** drag-and-drop is active, **When** player uses feature, **Then** normal click-to-build workflow still functions identically

---

### User Story 2 - Blueprint Mode (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want to see where buildings will be automatically placed when construction completes, so that I can plan my base layout in advance without waiting for each building to finish.

**Why this priority**: Essential for strategic base planning and enables concurrent construction planning, dramatically improving build efficiency.

**Independent Test**: Use drag-and-drop or normal building, verify blue blueprint appears on map, construction completes, building auto-places at blueprint.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** building is queued for construction, **When** blueprint is placed via drag-and-drop, **Then** blue overlay appears at target location with building name
2. **Given** blueprint is on map, **When** map tiles underneath are checked, **Then** blueprint does NOT block tiles in occupancy map
3. **Given** blueprint exists, **When** construction is in progress, **Then** blueprint remains visible showing pending placement
4. **Given** construction completes, **When** building is ready, **Then** system checks if blueprint location is still valid (unoccupied)
5. **Given** blueprint location is valid, **When** auto-placing, **Then** building appears at blueprint location and blueprint is removed
6. **Given** blueprint location is blocked, **When** auto-placing fails, **Then** building construction is paused/cancelled and player is notified
7. **Given** construction is cancelled (right-click on sidebar), **When** abort occurs, **Then** blueprint is immediately removed from map
8. **Given** normal build workflow is used, **When** NOT using drag-and-drop, **Then** blueprint mode does not interfere

---

### User Story 3 - Chain Build Mode (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to drag building buttons while holding shift to create lines of buildings, so that I can efficiently build walls, defenses, or power plants in organized patterns.

**Why this priority**: Powerful efficiency feature for creating defensive structures and organized base layouts, though not essential for basic gameplay.

**Independent Test**: Hold shift, drag concrete wall button onto map, release, move cursor to create line, click to lock line, repeat for multiple connected lines.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** shift key is held and building button is dragged, **When** released on map, **Then** first building blueprint is placed and Chain Build Mode (CBM) activates
2. **Given** CBM is active with first building placed, **When** cursor moves, **Then** preview line of buildings renders from first building to cursor position
3. **Given** preview line is rendering, **When** cursor position changes, **Then** line adjusts to show straight chain of buildings between start and cursor
4. **Given** preview line is shown, **When** player clicks, **Then** entire line of buildings is locked as blueprints and added to build queue
5. **Given** line is locked, **When** shift key is still held, **Then** endpoint becomes new startpoint and new preview line begins
6. **Given** multiple lines are chained, **When** shift key is released, **Then** CBM terminates and no further chains are created
7. **Given** chain of buildings is queued, **When** checking sidebar, **Then** build button stack counter increases by number of buildings in chain
8. **Given** CBM is active, **When** used, **Then** normal building mode and blueprint mode continue working without interference

---

### User Story 4 - Drag-and-Drop for Units (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to drag unit buttons from sidebar onto the map, so that newly built units automatically move to designated locations without manual commands.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have convenience feature that reduces micro-management for unit deployment, especially useful for defensive positioning.

**Independent Test**: Drag tank button onto map location, when tank is built, verify it automatically moves to marked location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** unit button in sidebar, **When** dragged onto map, **Then** unit icon follows cursor during drag
2. **Given** dragging unit button, **When** released on map location, **Then** location marker appears showing deployment target
3. **Given** unit is in production, **When** construction completes, **Then** unit spawns at factory normally
4. **Given** unit spawns, **When** deployment location is set, **Then** unit automatically paths to marked location
5. **Given** deployment location is reached, **When** unit arrives, **Then** location marker disappears and unit becomes idle
6. **Given** multiple units are queued with same drag target, **When** each completes, **Then** each unit moves to target area (slightly offset to avoid collision)

---

### User Story 5 - Construction Animations (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to see buildings materialize gradually with visual effects when placed, so that construction feels more dynamic and visually satisfying.

**Why this priority**: Polish feature that enhances game feel and visual feedback, though not affecting core gameplay mechanics.

**Independent Test**: Place any building, observe 3-second vertical reveal animation followed by 2-second color fade-in.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** building is placed on map, **When** placement occurs, **Then** building image begins rendering with 0% height (invisible)
2. **Given** construction animation starts, **When** 0-3 seconds elapse, **Then** building height clips from 0% to 100% (bottom to top reveal)
3. **Given** height animation completes at 3s, **When** moving to color phase, **Then** building is full height but desaturated (grayscale)
4. **Given** color animation phase, **When** 3-5 seconds elapse (2s duration), **Then** color fades from grayscale to full color
5. **Given** construction animation is in progress, **When** building is fully animated at 5s, **Then** building appears in final colored state
6. **Given** any building is placed, **When** construction animates, **Then** animation applies universally to all building types

---

### User Story 6 - Individual Factory Assembly Points (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to set unique rally points for each factory independently, so that different factories can deploy units to different strategic locations.

**Why this priority**: Important for strategic unit deployment and base organization, especially with multiple factories producing different unit types.

**Independent Test**: Build two factories, select first factory and right-click map to set assembly point, select second factory and set different point, verify units from each go to respective points.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a factory is built, **When** factory is selected, **Then** its current assembly point marker becomes visible on map
2. **Given** factory is selected, **When** player right-clicks on map, **Then** assembly point is set to clicked location for that specific factory
3. **Given** assembly point is set, **When** factory produces a unit, **Then** unit automatically moves to that factory's assembly point after spawning
4. **Given** multiple factories exist, **When** each has different assembly points, **Then** units from each factory move to their respective points
5. **Given** factory is not selected, **When** viewing map, **Then** assembly point markers are hidden to reduce visual clutter
6. **Given** factory is destroyed, **When** checking map, **Then** assembly point for that factory is removed
7. **Given** assembly point system is active, **When** used, **Then** it replaces old global building factory assembly point system

### Edge Cases

- What happens if blueprint location becomes blocked before construction finishes? (Auto-placement fails, construction may be cancelled or paused, player notified)
- Can chain build mode work with different building types? (No, chain is single building type; changing type ends chain)
- What if unit deployment location is blocked? (Unit still attempts to path, may get stuck or path to nearby free tile using A1 algorithm)
- What if the designated factory spawn tile is blocked by a building or unit? (Spawn logic cascades through neighboring tiles via breadth-first search until it finds the nearest passable, unoccupied tile for spawning)
- Can blueprints be cancelled after placement? (Yes, right-click on sidebar build button cancels construction and removes blueprint)
- What happens if player drags building onto invalid terrain? (Placement overlay shows red, release does not create blueprint)
- Can construction animation be skipped? (No, animation always plays for visual consistency, but brief at 5s total)
- What if multiple factories have overlapping assembly points? (Each factory's units go to their assigned point, may cluster if too close)
- Does chain build mode respect resource limits? (Yes, buildings are queued in production system with normal resource requirements)
- Can assembly points be set outside map boundaries? (No, clicks outside map are ignored, assembly point remains at previous location)
- What happens to drag-and-drop if sidebar is hidden? (Feature unavailable when sidebar not visible, normal workflow required)
