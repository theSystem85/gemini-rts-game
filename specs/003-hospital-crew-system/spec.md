# Feature Specification: Hospital & Crew System

**Feature Branch**: `003-hospital-crew-system`  
**Created**: 2025-11-05  
**Status**: Implemented (Retrospective Documentation)  
**Input**: User description: "Hospital building with 4-person tank crew system (driver, gunner, loader, commander), crew casualties, crew restoration, and ambulance unit for field recovery"

**Note**: This is a retrospective specification documenting an already-implemented feature for the CodeAndConquer RTS game.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Tank Crew System (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want my tanks to have individual crew members that can be killed when taking hits, so that combat has more strategic depth with unit capability degradation rather than just health loss.

**Why this priority**: Core mechanic that transforms damage from simple health depletion into tactical capability loss, requiring strategic decisions about crew restoration vs unit replacement. This is the foundation upon which the hospital and ambulance systems are built.

**Independent Test**: Build a tank, have it take damage from enemies, verify crew members can be individually killed (15% chance per hit) and tank capabilities degrade accordingly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a freshly built tank, **When** viewed, **Then** the tank displays 4 colored crew indicators: driver (blue, top-left), gunner (red, top-right), loader (yellow, bottom-left), commander (green, bottom-right)
2. **Given** a tank takes damage, **When** each hit is processed, **Then** there is a 15% probability each crew member is killed independently
3. **Given** the driver is killed, **When** player issues movement commands, **Then** the tank cannot move its wagon but can still rotate turret and fire at targets within range
4. **Given** the gunner is killed, **When** engaging enemies, **Then** the tank cannot rotate turret independently but can fire by rotating entire wagon to aim
5. **Given** the loader is killed, **When** attempting to fire, **Then** the tank cannot fire any weapons at all
6. **Given** the commander is killed, **When** player gives orders, **Then** the tank becomes unresponsive to player commands but autonomously defends itself and retreats to base if needed
7. **Given** a crew member is killed, **When** the death event occurs, **Then** appropriate sound plays (driverIsOut.mp3, gunnerIsOut.mp3, loaderIsOut.mp3, commanderIsOut.mp3)

### User Story 2 - Hospital Building (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want to build a hospital where my damaged tanks can restore killed crew members, so that I can repair veteran units without replacing them entirely and continue using experienced units.

**Why this priority**: Essential infrastructure for crew system - without it, crew casualties would be permanent and the system would be purely punishing rather than strategic. This unlocks the ambulance unit and provides base-level crew restoration.

**Independent Test**: Build a hospital (4000 credits), move a tank with missing crew to the 3 tiles below it, verify crew restoration occurs over time at 100 credits per person.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sufficient resources (4000 credits and 50MW available power), **When** player builds a hospital, **Then** a building is placed with 200 health and -50MW power consumption
2. **Given** a tank with missing crew members, **When** positioned on any of the 3 tiles directly below the hospital, **Then** crew restoration begins automatically
3. **Given** crew restoration is active, **When** 10 seconds elapse per crew member, **Then** one crew member is restored and 100 credits are deducted
4. **Given** multiple crew members need restoration, **When** at hospital, **Then** crew members are restored one at a time in specific order: driver → commander → loader → gunner
5. **Given** player has insufficient funds, **When** crew restoration is in progress, **Then** restoration pauses until sufficient funds become available
6. **Given** hospital is built, **When** checking vehicle factory build menu, **Then** ambulance unit becomes available for construction
7. **Given** hospital is destroyed, **When** checking build menu, **Then** ambulance build option becomes disabled/unavailable

---

### User Story 3 - Ambulance Unit (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to build ambulance units that can restore crew members in the field without requiring tanks to return to base, so that I can maintain combat effectiveness during extended operations and reduce downtime.

**Why this priority**: Provides tactical flexibility and field support, though not essential for basic crew system functionality. Enhances strategic depth by allowing forward medical support.

**Independent Test**: Build a hospital (unlocks ambulance), build an ambulance (500 credits), command it to restore crew on a damaged tank, verify crew restoration occurs in 2 seconds per person.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a hospital exists, **When** viewing vehicle factory build menu, **Then** ambulance unit becomes available for 500 credits with 25 health
2. **Given** an ambulance is built, **When** deployed, **Then** unit starts with 10 people on board (100% loading bar), moves 3x faster than tank on streets and 1.5x faster on grass
3. **Given** an ambulance is selected, **When** hovering over friendly unit with missing crew, **Then** cursor changes to "moveInto" cursor indicating restoration is possible
4. **Given** ambulance is commanded to restore unit, **When** within 1 tile range, **Then** restoration begins taking 2 seconds per crew member
5. **Given** restoration is in progress, **When** crew transfers, **Then** ambulance loading bar decreases proportionally and unit crew indicators appear
6. **Given** ambulance runs out of crew (0% loading bar), **When** empty, **Then** ambulance must return to hospital to reload, similar to harvester refinery mechanics
7. **Given** crew restoration completes, **When** finished, **Then** appropriate sound effects play and both units can resume normal operations

---

### User Story 4 - AI & Crew Management (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want enemy AI units to have the same crew system and for AI to manage crew casualties intelligently, so that the game remains balanced and challenging.

**Why this priority**: Critical for game balance - AI must have same capabilities and limitations to provide appropriate challenge and fair gameplay.

**Independent Test**: Let AI units take damage and lose crew, verify AI units behave identically to player units and AI manages crew restoration appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an AI unit is built, **When** deployed, **Then** it has 4 crew members with same capabilities as player units
2. **Given** an AI unit takes damage, **When** crew member dies, **Then** AI unit suffers identical capability loss as player units
3. **Given** AI has hospital and ambulances, **When** units have missing crew, **Then** AI sends damaged units to hospital or ambulances for restoration
4. **Given** AI unit with dead commander, **When** operating, **Then** AI unit operates autonomously for self-defense and retreat (not player-controllable behavior)
5. **Given** AI manages multiple damaged units, **When** prioritizing restoration, **Then** AI sends units back to hospital before continuing battle (strategic crew management)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a tank with dead commander is given orders? (Cannot be controlled by player, operates autonomously for self-defense and retreat only)
- How does AI handle crew casualties? (AI units have same crew system and AI manages restoration by sending units to hospital/ambulances)
- What happens if hospital is destroyed while restoring crew? (Restoration stops immediately, crew member in progress remains missing, must find alternative restoration)
- Can ambulances restore their own crew? (No, ambulances don't have crew system - they only carry cargo capacity of 10 people)
- What happens to crew status when unit is sold? (Units with missing crew cannot be sold - only fully operational or fully repaired units can be sold)
- What if player has insufficient funds during restoration? (Restoration pauses until funds become available, progress is not lost)
- What happens when tank with missing crew levels up? (Level and experience are preserved independently of crew status)
- What if multiple tanks need restoration simultaneously at hospital? (They queue up, one processes at a time on the 3 restoration tiles)
- Can ambulance restore crew while moving? (No, ambulance must be within 1 tile range and stationary for restoration to begin)
- What happens when ambulance is destroyed with crew on board? (Crew cargo is lost, no experience or resources recovered)
