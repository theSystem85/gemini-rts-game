# Feature Specification: Advanced Unit Control

**Feature Branch**: `004-advanced-unit-control`  
**Created**: 2025-11-05  
**Status**: Implemented (Retrospective Documentation)  
**Input**: User description: "Remote control, guard mode, path planning, and attack group features for enhanced tactical unit management"

**Note**: This is a retrospective specification documenting an already-implemented feature for the CodeAndConquer RTS game.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Remote Control Feature (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to directly control selected tanks using arrow keys and space bar, so that I can manually navigate tight situations, dodge incoming fire, and have precise control during critical moments.

**Why this priority**: Provides advanced tactical control for skilled players but not essential for basic gameplay. Enhances player agency and enables micro-management strategies.

**Independent Test**: Select a tank, use arrow keys to move forward/backward and turn left/right, press space to fire at maximum range.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** one or more tanks are selected, **When** arrow up key is held, **Then** selected tanks move forward in their current facing direction
2. **Given** one or more tanks are selected, **When** arrow down key is held, **Then** selected tanks move backward in their current facing direction
3. **Given** one or more tanks are selected, **When** arrow left key is held, **Then** selected tanks rotate wagon left (counter-clockwise)
4. **Given** one or more tanks are selected, **When** arrow right key is held, **Then** selected tanks rotate wagon right (clockwise)
5. **Given** one or more tanks are selected, **When** space key is pressed, **Then** tanks fire at the farthest point within firing range in their current facing direction
6. **Given** remote control is active, **When** tanks move or turn, **Then** turrets continue tracking targets independently of wagon rotation
7. **Given** remote control keys are released, **When** player gives normal move/attack commands, **Then** units seamlessly transition back to standard control mode

---

### User Story 2 - Guard Mode Feature (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to assign combat units to guard other units, so that they automatically protect valuable units (like harvesters or key tanks) without requiring constant micro-management.

**Why this priority**: Provides automated defensive tactics, reduces micro-management burden, and enables strategic unit protection especially for resource gathering.

**Independent Test**: Select a combat unit, hold Cmd/Ctrl, click on friendly harvester, verify the combat unit follows and defends the harvester.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a combat unit is selected and Cmd/Ctrl key is held, **When** cursor hovers over friendly unit, **Then** cursor changes to guard cursor (guard.svg)
2. **Given** guard cursor is active, **When** player clicks on friendly unit, **Then** selected unit enters guard mode for that target
3. **Given** unit is in guard mode, **When** guarded unit moves, **Then** guarding unit follows at appropriate distance
4. **Given** unit is in guard mode, **When** enemy enters attack range, **Then** guarding unit attacks enemy automatically
5. **Given** unit is in guard mode attacking, **When** enemy moves away, **Then** guarding unit does not chase beyond guard range and returns to following guarded unit
6. **Given** unit is in guard mode, **When** given any other command (move, attack, new guard target), **Then** guard mode is cancelled and unit follows new orders
7. **Given** guarded unit is destroyed, **When** guard target becomes invalid, **Then** guarding unit reverts to idle state

---

### User Story 3 - Path Planning Feature (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to queue multiple commands for my units using shift-click, so that I can set up complex patrol routes, attack sequences, or tactical maneuvers in advance.

**Why this priority**: Enables advanced tactical planning and reduces need for constant attention to individual units, though basic command-response gameplay works without it.

**Independent Test**: Select units, hold shift, click multiple locations and enemies in sequence, verify units execute commands in order.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** units are selected and shift key is held, **When** player clicks on map location, **Then** move command is added to unit command queue without clearing previous commands
2. **Given** units have queued commands and shift is held, **When** player clicks on enemy, **Then** attack command is added to queue after current commands
3. **Given** units have queued move commands, **When** player shift-clicks to retreat location, **Then** retreat command is added to queue
4. **Given** units have queued commands, **When** executing queue, **Then** commands execute in order: first queued → last queued
5. **Given** units are executing queued commands, **When** player issues non-shift command, **Then** command queue is cleared and new command executes immediately
6. **Given** shift key is held, **When** dragging box around multiple enemies (AGF), **Then** attack group command is added to queue
7. **Given** units are selected with shift held, **When** clicking friendly units, **Then** friendly units are added to selection (does not queue command)

---

### User Story 4 - Attack Group Feature (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want to select multiple enemy units at once for my combat units to attack sequentially, so that I can efficiently eliminate groups of enemies without manually targeting each one.

**Why this priority**: Core tactical feature that significantly improves combat efficiency and reduces tedious micro-management during battles.

**Independent Test**: Select friendly combat units, click and drag red box around enemy group, verify selected units attack all marked enemies one by one.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** friendly combat units are selected, **When** player clicks and holds left mouse button, **Then** red selection box begins drawing from click point
2. **Given** red selection box is being drawn, **When** box encompasses enemy units, **Then** enemy units within box are highlighted as targets
3. **Given** red box selection is released, **When** box contained enemy units, **Then** all enemies in box are marked with red triangular indicators above health bars
4. **Given** units have marked attack targets, **When** engaging enemies, **Then** units attack marked enemies one by one in order they were marked
5. **Given** marked enemy is destroyed, **When** target eliminated, **Then** red triangle disappears and attacking units move to next marked target
6. **Given** units are in AGF mode, **When** player gives any new command (move, attack, guard), **Then** AGF mode cancels and new command executes
7. **Given** units are attacking marked targets, **When** units are reselected, **Then** red attack indicators remain visible showing attack queue status
8. **Given** marked target moves, **When** during combat, **Then** red triangle indicator follows target unit position
9. **Given** AGF is combined with shift (PPF), **When** box selecting enemies with shift held, **Then** attack group command is queued after current commands

### Edge Cases

- What happens when remote control keys conflict with other shortcuts? (Remote control only active when combat units selected and no input fields have focus)
- Can harvesters use remote control? (Yes, remote control works for any selected unit capable of movement and rotation)
- What happens if guarded unit enters AGF mode? (Guarding unit maintains guard behavior, does not join AGF unless explicitly commanded)
- Can units guard multiple targets? (No, assigning new guard target replaces previous one)
- What if path planning queue becomes very long (50+ commands)? (No hard limit, but performance may degrade - practical limit around 20 commands)
- What happens when AGF targets are all out of range? (Units path to closest target, engage when in range, then move to next)
- Can remote control and guard mode be active simultaneously? (No, remote control input overrides guard mode temporarily)
- What if marked AGF targets are destroyed by other units? (Marked targets are automatically removed from queue when destroyed by any source)
- Can units in PPF queue mix move and attack commands? (Yes, any command type can be queued: move, attack, retreat, AGF)
- What happens to queued commands when unit is damaged and flees? (Retreat behavior overrides queue; queue is cleared when unit enters flee mode)
