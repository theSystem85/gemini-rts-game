# Feature Specification: Combat System Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `006-combat-system-enhancements`  
**Created**: 2025-11-05  
**Status**: Implemented (Retrospective Documentation)  
**Input**: User description: "Hit zone damage system, recoil and muzzle flash effects, enemy retaliation, tank variants (V2/V3), rocket tank improvements, and target indicators"

**Note**: This is a retrospective specification documenting an already-implemented feature for the CodeAndConquer RTS game.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Hit Zone Damage System (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want tank damage to vary based on where the shot hits (front, side, rear), so that tactical positioning and flanking maneuvers provide meaningful combat advantages.

**Why this priority**: Core combat mechanic that adds tactical depth and rewards strategic positioning, transforming combat from simple DPS calculation to positional warfare.

**Independent Test**: Attack enemy tank from front (1.0x damage), side (1.3x damage), and rear (2.0x damage), verify damage differences and tactical impact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tank is hit from the front, **When** damage is calculated, **Then** base damage is multiplied by 1.0x (no modifier)
2. **Given** a tank is hit from the rear, **When** damage is calculated, **Then** base damage is multiplied by 2.0x (double damage)
3. **Given** a tank is hit from the side (left or right), **When** damage is calculated, **Then** base damage is multiplied by 1.3x (30% bonus)
4. **Given** hit zone system is active, **When** critical rear hit occurs, **Then** "critical_damage" sound plays for player units only
5. **Given** hit zones are calculated, **When** determining which zone, **Then** system uses angle between shooter and target facing direction
6. **Given** any tank type, **When** receiving hits, **Then** hit zone multipliers apply universally to all tank variants

### User Story 2 - Recoil & Muzzle Flash Effects (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to see visual feedback when tanks fire (recoil animation and muzzle flash), so that combat feels more dynamic and impactful.

**Why this priority**: Polish feature that significantly enhances combat feel and visual satisfaction, though not affecting core mechanics.

**Independent Test**: Command tank to fire at enemy, verify gun barrel recoils backward up to 5 pixels and muzzle flash appears at barrel tip.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tank fires a weapon, **When** shot is triggered, **Then** gun barrel begins recoil animation moving backward along barrel axis
2. **Given** recoil animation starts, **When** animating, **Then** barrel moves up to 5 pixels backward using dampened movement
3. **Given** recoil reaches maximum, **When** animation completes, **Then** barrel returns to normal position smoothly
4. **Given** gun fires, **When** projectile launches, **Then** muzzle flash renders at barrel tip with configurable offset
5. **Given** muzzle flash appears, **When** rendered, **Then** flash follows recoil movement (stays at barrel tip during recoil)
6. **Given** muzzle flash is shown, **When** brief display time elapses, **Then** flash disappears after 2-3 frames
7. **Given** recoil and flash are active, **When** tank uses image-based rendering, **Then** effects apply to gun barrel component specifically
8. **Given** recoil system is implemented, **When** using fallback rendering, **Then** recoil applies to turret visualization appropriately

---

### User Story 3 - Enemy Retaliation System (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want enemy units to always fight back when attacked, so that combat feels reactive and aggressive rather than passive.

**Why this priority**: Core AI behavior that ensures engaging combat and prevents exploitation of passive enemies, critical for balanced gameplay.

**Independent Test**: Attack enemy unit, verify it immediately retaliates by attacking back unless in flee mode (< 10% health).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an enemy unit is hit by bullet, **When** damage is applied, **Then** enemy tracks attacker and marks itself as "being attacked"
2. **Given** enemy is being attacked, **When** next AI update occurs (every 2s), **Then** enemy prioritizes retaliating against attacker
3. **Given** enemy is retaliating, **When** attacker is in range (< 15 tiles for units), **Then** enemy engages and fires back
4. **Given** enemy is hit by building (Tesla coil, turret), **When** attacked, **Then** enemy retaliates against building if in range (< 20 tiles)
5. **Given** enemy takes explosion damage, **When** AOE hit occurs, **Then** enemy retaliates against original shooter (not explosion center)
6. **Given** enemy is below 10% health, **When** in flee mode, **Then** retaliation is suppressed and unit continues fleeing to base
7. **Given** attacker moves out of range or is destroyed, **When** retaliation target becomes invalid, **Then** enemy resumes normal AI behavior
8. **Given** retaliation is active, **When** 5 seconds elapse with no new hits, **Then** "being attacked" flag resets and retaliation ends

---

### User Story 4 - Tank V2 & V3 Variants (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want access to upgraded tank variants with enhanced capabilities (aim-ahead prediction for V2, improved stats for V3), so that I can progress to more powerful units.

**Why this priority**: Provides unit progression and variety, though basic tanks are sufficient for core gameplay. Enhances strategic depth with unit specialization.

**Independent Test**: Build Tank V2, attack moving target, verify aim-ahead prediction hits target. Build Tank V3, verify it has V2 capabilities plus 30% more health.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Tank V2 is built, **When** engaging moving target, **Then** firing system calculates aim-ahead based on target velocity and direction
2. **Given** aim-ahead is active, **When** firing at moving target, **Then** projectile aims at predicted future position rather than current position
3. **Given** Tank V2 fires with aim-ahead, **When** target maintains trajectory, **Then** hit probability increases significantly vs non-predictive aiming
4. **Given** Tank V3 is built, **When** checking capabilities, **Then** unit has all Tank V2 features including aim-ahead
5. **Given** Tank V3 is compared to V1, **When** checking stats, **Then** V3 has 30% more health than standard tank
6. **Given** Tank V3 is purchased, **When** built, **Then** cost is 3000 credits (higher than V1/V2)
7. **Given** any tank variant, **When** in combat, **Then** hit zone system, recoil, and all other combat features apply equally

---

### User Story 5 - Rocket Tank Improvements (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want rocket tanks to fire multiple projectiles per volley with slower but more visible rockets, so that rocket units feel distinct from regular tanks.

**Why this priority**: Unit differentiation and variety, creates distinct tactical role for rocket units with area suppression capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Build rocket tank, command to attack, verify it fires 3 rockets per volley with visibly slower projectiles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** rocket tank fires, **When** volley is triggered, **Then** 3 projectiles launch instead of single projectile
2. **Given** 3 rockets fire, **When** damage is calculated, **Then** each rocket does proportionally less damage (balanced vs single shot)
3. **Given** rockets are fired, **When** traveling, **Then** projectiles move 4x slower than standard tank bullets
4. **Given** slow rockets, **When** observed by player, **Then** rockets are easily visible and trackable across map
5. **Given** rocket tank is built, **When** viewing unit, **Then** unit displays 3 static tubes on top (no rotating turret)
6. **Given** rocket tank engages, **When** aiming, **Then** entire wagon rotates to point at target (no independent turret)
7. **Given** rocket tank fires, **When** projectiles hit, **Then** explosions occur at impact points creating visual distinction from bullets

---

### User Story 6 - Target Indicators (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to see visual indicators showing where my units are moving and attacking, so that I can track unit orders at a glance without constant micro-management.

**Why this priority**: Quality-of-life feature that improves clarity and reduces need to watch every unit, though basic gameplay works without it.

**Independent Test**: Command units to move and attack, verify green triangles appear at move destinations and red triangles appear above attack targets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** units are commanded to move, **When** move order is issued, **Then** green upside-down triangles appear at destination tiles
2. **Given** green indicators are shown, **When** units are selected, **Then** indicators remain visible showing active movement orders
3. **Given** units are commanded to attack, **When** attack order is issued, **Then** red upside-down triangles appear above target units
4. **Given** red indicators are shown, **When** attacker is selected, **Then** indicators remain visible showing active attack orders
5. **Given** units use AGF (attack group), **When** multiple targets marked, **Then** both red (attack) and green (move) indicators show as appropriate
6. **Given** indicators are visible, **When** units move during combat, **Then** indicators update position in real-time following targets
7. **Given** attack completes or target destroyed, **When** order finishes, **Then** indicator disappears automatically
8. **Given** unit is reselected, **When** viewing unit, **Then** active order indicators reappear showing current status

### Edge Cases

- What happens when rear hit occurs on already low-health tank? (Damage applies normally, may result in one-shot kill)
- Can hit zones be exploited by circling enemies? (Yes, this is intended tactical gameplay - positioning matters)
- What if recoil animation is interrupted by death? (Animation stops immediately, no visual artifacts)
- What happens when enemy retaliates but player unit already died? (Retaliation target becomes invalid, enemy resumes normal behavior)
- Can Tank V2 aim-ahead handle erratic movement patterns? (Prediction assumes straight-line trajectory, fails if target changes course)
- What if rocket tank fires at very close range? (All 3 rockets hit almost instantly, maximum damage output at close range)
- What happens to indicators when unit enters guard mode? (Guard mode indicators override attack indicators)
- Can indicators stack if multiple units attack same target? (Each attacking unit shows its own red indicator on shared target)
- What if muzzle flash position is misconfigured? (Falls back to default offset, may look slightly off but doesn't break)
- How does retaliation interact with unit levels? (Level bonuses (range, armor, fire rate) apply during retaliation combat)
