# Spec: Sidebar Visual Gradient Polish

## Summary
Apply a subtle, professional vertical gradient to the main sidebar container so it appears less flat while keeping contrast and readability for existing UI content.

## Requirements
- Preserve current sidebar dimensions, spacing, and text color behavior.
- Keep the existing dark theme and avoid high-contrast or distracting effects.
- Implement gradient styling on `#sidebar` using CSS so it works with current layout states.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Sidebar background renders as a gentle dark gradient in desktop and mobile layouts.
- Sidebar text and controls remain legible with no functional regressions.
