## Functional Requirements

### Core AI Framework

#### FR-001: Party System Architecture
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** Game state maintains array of exactly 4 parties with party index 0 always being human player and indices 1-3 being AI-controlled players. Each party object contains resources, buildings, units, and strategic state.

#### FR-002: AI Update Cycle
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI decision-making runs at consistent intervals (default 3000ms) to simulate planning delays and prevent instant reactions. Update cycle processes economy, construction, production, and combat decisions in sequence.

#### FR-003: Party Resource Tracking
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** Each AI party tracks money independently with initial value matching human player. Resources are spent on construction and production, earned through ore harvesting and refineries.

#### FR-004: AI State Persistence
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI strategic state (current focus, last decisions, timers) persists across update cycles to enable long-term planning and avoid erratic behavior.

---

### Energy Management

#### FR-005: Power Supply Calculation
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI calculates total power supply from all owned Power Plants (100 power each). Power demand calculated from all owned buildings with power requirements.

#### FR-006: Power Plant Priority
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** When power demand exceeds supply by threshold (>80%), AI prioritizes Power Plant construction above other buildings to prevent brownouts.

#### FR-007: Power Shortage Handling
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** When AI experiences power shortage, building construction and unit production slow or halt appropriately. AI detects shortage and queues additional Power Plants.

---

### Base Construction

#### FR-008: Construction Yard Management
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI starts with one Construction Yard. If destroyed, AI attempts to rebuild using MCV if available. Construction Yard enables all building placement.

#### FR-009: War Factory Construction
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI constructs War Factory as early priority to enable vehicle production. Typically constructed within first 2 build cycles after initial Power Plant.

#### FR-010: Ore Refinery Construction
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI builds Ore Refinery to process harvested ore into money. Places refinery near ore fields when possible for harvester efficiency.

#### FR-011: Defensive Structure Placement
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI constructs Gun Turrets and SAM Sites at strategic positions around base perimeter. Turret placement prioritizes coverage of entry points and high-value buildings.

#### FR-012: Building Placement Algorithm
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI places buildings near existing structures to create compact base layout. Validates tile availability, checks for overlaps, ensures buildings are on valid terrain.

#### FR-013: Building Prerequisites
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI respects technology tree prerequisites (e.g., Advanced structures require Tech Center). Builds prerequisite structures before advanced ones.

---

### Unit Production

#### FR-014: Vehicle Production Queue
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI queues vehicles (Tanks, Rocket Tanks, Harvesters, Apache Helicopters, Howitzers) at War Factory. Production prioritizes economy (harvesters) early, transitions to combat units mid-game.

#### FR-015: Unit Cost Validation
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI checks money availability before queuing units. Deducts costs immediately on queue to prevent over-spending. Handles production failures gracefully.

#### FR-016: Production Timing
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI spaces production commands to avoid flooding queues. Allows factories to complete current production before queuing next batch. Maintains steady unit flow.

#### FR-017: Harvester Production
**Priority:** P1
**Description:** AI produces replacement harvesters when existing ones are destroyed or insufficient for optimal income. Targets 2-3 active harvesters per refinery.

#### FR-018: Automated Building Repairs
**Priority:** P1
**Description:** AI players monitor their structures for damage and queue repairs using the same 10-second post-attack cooldown enforced on the human player. When available funds fall below a low-budget threshold, AI must prioritize repairing critical infrastructure (construction yard, power plants, refineries, vehicle factories/workshops, radar) before restoring non-essential defenses or tech buildings.

#### FR-019: Army Composition
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI maintains balanced army composition: ~70% combat vehicles (tanks, rocket tanks, apache), ~20% heavy units (howitzers, tank-v3), ~10% support units (harvesters, ambulances, tankers). Adjusts ratios based on game phase and threat assessment.

---

### Strategic Decision Making

#### FR-020: Threat Assessment
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI detects enemy units near its base by proximity checking. Assigns threat levels based on enemy unit count and types. Triggers defensive responses when threat exceeds threshold.

#### FR-021: Attack Wave Generation
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI periodically assembles attack groups (5-15 units) and sends toward enemy base locations. Attack frequency increases as AI army size grows. Groups prefer mixed unit compositions.

#### FR-022: Base Defense Priority
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** When AI base is under attack, units retreat toward home base and engage attackers. Defensive turrets provide fire support. AI temporarily halts offensive operations during defense.

#### FR-023: Expansion Strategy
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** AI expands base area by placing buildings progressively farther from Construction Yard. Secures ore fields by placing refineries and defensive structures nearby.

#### FR-024: Critical Structure Rebuilding
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI detects destruction of critical buildings (Power Plant, War Factory, Refinery) and prioritizes rebuilding them. Rebuilds at original location if possible, otherwise finds new suitable position.

---

### Combat Behavior

#### FR-025: Automatic Target Engagement
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI units automatically detect and engage enemy units within weapon range. Target selection prioritizes closest threats, then high-value targets (harvesters, damaged units).

#### FR-026: Pursuit Logic
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI units pursue fleeing enemies up to maximum chase distance (5-10 tiles). Pursuit terminates if unit strays too far from assigned area or encounters stronger resistance.

#### FR-027: Retreat Behavior
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** Damaged AI units (health < 30%) attempt to retreat toward friendly base or nearby defensive structures. Retreat overrides offensive commands temporarily.

#### FR-028: Focus Fire Coordination
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** Multiple AI units in same area implicitly coordinate targeting by prioritizing same enemies. Creates focus fire effect without explicit communication system.

#### FR-029: Anti-Air Targeting
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI Rocket Tanks and SAM Sites prioritize aircraft targets when detected. Ground units ignore aircraft to let specialized anti-air units handle them.

---

### Harvester Management

#### FR-030: Harvester Pathfinding
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI harvesters automatically pathfind to nearest ore field, collect ore, and return to refinery. Pathfinding avoids combat zones and enemy base areas when possible.

#### FR-031: Harvester Protection
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** When AI harvester is attacked, nearby combat units move to protect it. Harvester attempts to flee toward base while escort engages attackers.

#### FR-032: Ore Field Assignment
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** AI assigns harvesters to different ore fields to maximize collection efficiency. Harvesters avoid clustering at same ore patch.

#### FR-033: Harvester Replacement
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI tracks harvester count and produces replacements when destroyed. Ensures minimum 1 harvester per refinery to maintain economy.

---

### AI-to-AI Interaction

#### FR-034: Multi-AI Coordination
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** Multiple AI players indirectly coordinate through shared enemy detection. All AI parties target human player, creating implicit alliance against human.

#### FR-035: Resource Competition
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** AI players compete for ore fields on map. First AI to secure ore field with refinery gains economic advantage. AI avoids building too close to other AI bases.

#### FR-036: Combat Between AI Players
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** AI players can engage each other if units encounter in neutral territory, but prioritize human player as primary target. Reduces AI-vs-AI conflicts to keep focus on player.

---

### Performance & Optimization

#### FR-037: AI Update Throttling
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI decision-making throttled to run at 3-second intervals (configurable) to reduce CPU load. Prevents performance degradation with multiple active AI players.

#### FR-038: Unit Count Limits
**Priority:** P1  
**Description:** AI respects global unit count limits (typically 100-200 units total across all parties). Prevents infinite unit production that could cause performance issues.

#### FR-039: Spatial Queries Optimization
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** AI uses spatial partitioning or proximity checks to efficiently find nearby units/buildings. Avoids O(n²) distance calculations every frame.

---

### AI Configuration & Tuning

#### FR-040: Difficulty Settings (Future)
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** System designed to support difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard) that adjust AI reaction times, production speed, and decision quality. Currently operates at single difficulty.

#### FR-041: AI Personality Variants (Future)
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** Framework supports different AI personality types (aggressive, defensive, economic) with different strategic priorities. Currently all AI players use same strategy.

#### FR-042: Configurable Timing Parameters
**Priority:** P2  
**Description:** AI timing parameters (update interval, attack frequency, build delays) are configurable constants rather than hardcoded values for easy tuning.

---

### Integration & Coordination

#### FR-043: Game State Integration
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI system reads from and writes to centralized gameState object. AI decisions affect units, buildings, and resources through standard game systems (same as player actions).

#### FR-044: Enemy System Integration
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI integrates with enemy unit behavior system (src/enemy.js, src/ai/enemyUnitBehavior.js) to control unit movement and combat actions. All AI units follow same behavioral rules.

#### FR-045: Building System Integration
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI uses standard building placement and construction systems (src/game/buildingSystem.js). AI construction follows same validation rules as player building.

#### FR-046: Production Queue Integration
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI queues units through standard production system (src/productionQueue.js). Production timing and costs enforced by same system used for player.

#### FR-047: Victory Condition Integration
**Priority:** P0  
**Description:** AI defeat occurs when all AI buildings and units are destroyed (same as player defeat). Game ends when only one party remains with buildings.

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

1. **AI Starts with No Valid Building Space:** If AI spawn point blocked by terrain/units, AI uses flood-fill algorithm to find nearest valid construction zone, falls back to random location if none found within reasonable distance.

2. **AI Runs Out of Money Early Game:** AI includes minimum cash reserve check before expensive purchases, prioritizes harvester production to restart economy, can remain idle temporarily until income resumes.

3. **All AI Harvesters Destroyed:** AI detects zero harvesters + existing refinery scenario, immediately queues replacement harvester with high priority, borrows from building budget if necessary to prevent economic collapse.

4. **AI Base Completely Destroyed:** AI enters "defeated" state, stops all decision-making to save CPU, units become uncontrolled (basic defensive behavior only), no respawn mechanics.

5. **Player Destroys AI Construction Yard Early:** AI attempts to deploy MCV if one exists in unit roster, if no MCV available AI cannot rebuild and effectively loses, this is valid game design (punishes failure to defend critical structure).

6. **AI Power Plant Destroyed Causing Brownout:** AI detects power shortage state, immediately queues Power Plant as highest priority, temporarily pauses non-essential production, resumes normal operations once power restored.

7. **AI Units Get Stuck in Pathfinding Loop:** Units have maximum pathfinding retry count (3-5 attempts), after retries exhausted unit chooses random nearby valid position as alternate destination, prevents infinite loops.

8. **Multiple AI Players Target Same Resources:** First AI to place refinery "claims" ore field, other AI use distance checks to prefer unclaimed fields, competition is implicit through building placement, no explicit territory system.

9. **AI Attempts to Build Invalid Structure:** Building placement validation catches invalid positions (overlaps, out of bounds, terrain restrictions), AI retries with slightly offset position (2-5 tile radius), gives up after 3-5 failed attempts.

10. **AI Update Cycle Runs During Heavy Game Load:** AI update designed to be interruptible, if frame budget exceeded AI defers remaining decisions to next cycle, ensures game doesn't freeze even with 3 active AI players.

11. **AI Tries to Produce Unit Without Prerequisites:** Production system validates tech tree requirements before queuing, AI receives failure callback, adds prerequisite building to construction queue first, retries unit production on subsequent cycles.

12. **Save/Load with AI State:** AI strategic state (timers, current focus) is reset on game load to prevent stale data, AI resumes normal decision-making from current game state, no long-term memory persists across sessions.

## Implementation Notes

**AI Architecture:**
- AI system follows hierarchical design: Strategic layer (economy, expansion) → Tactical layer (unit groups, attacks) → Operational layer (individual unit behaviors)
- Each AI party maintains independent state machine tracking current strategic focus (economy, military buildup, attack, defense)
- AI decisions are time-sliced across multiple frames to prevent CPU spikes from complex calculations
- System designed for extensibility - easy to add new strategies, behaviors, or unit types

**Balancing Philosophy:**
- AI deliberately includes slight delays and imperfect decision-making to feel "human-like" rather than optimally efficient
- AI has same resource constraints, costs, and tech tree as human player (no cheating)
- Multiple AI opponents create challenge through numbers, not individual superiority
- AI difficulty tuning achieved through timing adjustments rather than resource bonuses

**Known Limitations:**
- AI lacks long-term strategic planning (no multi-minute plans, reacts to immediate state)
- AI doesn't use advanced tactics like flanking, feints, or coordinated multi-front attacks
- No explicit communication between AI players - coordination is emergent behavior only
- AI building placement is functional but not optimally efficient (doesn't minimize unit travel distance)
- AI doesn't adapt to specific player strategies (no learning or counter-building)

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Difficulty levels with tunable parameters (reaction time, production speed, decision quality)
- AI personality types with distinct strategies (rusher, turtle, macro-focused)
- Improved target prioritization (focus harvesters, target low-health units)
- Coordinated attacks between multiple AI players against common enemy
- Better base layout planning (optimized refinery placement near ore, defensive perimeter)
