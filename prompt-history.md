The gun is not aligned with the wagon. It needs to be rotated 90deg counter clockwise.

use public/images/map/units/tankV1_barrel.png also for the howitzer so that when the howitzer aims at a target the barrel is lifted to point into the air for a ballistic trajectory. The howitzer has no turret to turn for aiming so the entire wagon is turning into direction of the target (already implemented). Come up with a nice realistic looks transformation and animation so that the barrel will point into the same direction the grande will start to fly along as well. the mounting point on the gun barrel is 2x0y and the mounting point on the howitzer is 30x30y (based on the original image assets for the map). Ensure there is also a retreat and flash animation similar to the one of the tank and make it a bit stronger. The flash should go to both sides and not in all directions. Make sure the howitzer does not fire before it has lifted his gun barrel slowly at the target. Also ensure the howitzer does not start to drive before it has lowered its gun barrel to be parallel to ground level again. Lifting and lowering it can take up to 4s depending on how far away the target is.
