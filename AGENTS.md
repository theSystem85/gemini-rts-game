RULES for agentic codeing
1) do not try to run a development server
2) do not try to run the linter
3) with every prompt update the relevant TODO file in the TODO/ folder (Improvements.md, Bugs.md, or Features.md) with the incoming new or changed requirements AND also update the any affected specs inside the specs folder or add new specs when needed
4) put the content of any prompt into the prompt-history folder and for each prompt create a new file inside that folder that has the UTC timestamp as its name followed by an underscore and up to 3 word summary (with dashes as separators) of the prompt so a user can quickly identify what the prompt was about when reading the filename. The file is and .md file with UTC timestamp added on top and the name of the LLM that processed it (copilot, chatGPT, codex, ...).
5) when adding new buildings to the game the sidebar image can be found in public/images/sidebar and the image to render the building on the map in public/images/map/buildings
6) when adding new units to the game the sidebar image can be found in public/images/sidebar and the image to render the unit on the map in public/images/map/units
7) when the image assets for the new units are not specified in the prompt search the content of the folders mentioned in rule 5 and 6 for matching filenames. The names should be self explanatory so you could easily match them to the new units or buildings that you have to implement. The assets are usually added to the repo before you have to start the implementation.
8) ALL LAND UNITS (tanks, trucks, harvesters, etc.) must spawn from the Vehicle Factory, not the Construction Yard. Apache helicopters spawn from Helipads. When adding a new land unit, always add it to the `vehicleUnitTypes` array in `src/productionQueue.js` to ensure proper spawn location.
9) Anser every prompt (when you actually changed code) with a last section that contains a commit message describing your last changes for the user to copy paste
