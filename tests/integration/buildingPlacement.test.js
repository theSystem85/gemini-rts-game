/**
 * Integration tests for building placement near Construction Yard
 *
 * Tests the building placement validation logic to ensure:
 * 1. Buildings can be placed within MAX_BUILDING_GAP_TILES of existing buildings
 * 2. Buildings cannot be placed beyond the allowed distance
 *
 * The game uses Chebyshev distance (chess king distance) for proximity checks.
 * MAX_BUILDING_GAP_TILES is currently 3.
