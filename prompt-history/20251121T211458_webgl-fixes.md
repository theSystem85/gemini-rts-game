User Prompt:
"it works! but there some smaller issues to fix:
1) there are some black bars (smaller that a tile diameter) on top right side if I scroll the map to top right direction and on bottom left when I scroll there. I guess the map has to load some buffer tiles around the edges of the visible map to be available immediately when scrolling into viewport. see attached image
2) the water looks just blue now but before it was an animation (sequence of tiles played in a loop to show moving water animation)

Fix both issues now!"
