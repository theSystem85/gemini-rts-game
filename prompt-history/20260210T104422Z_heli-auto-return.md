## Prompt
ensure when helis are attacking and they run out of ammo that they automatically fly back to helipad, then reload and when fully reloaded they go back to attack their target unit is is destroyed. When the target is destroyed they automatically fly back to their helipad. Also ensure the helis actually land on the helipad when they reach it. There is sometimes a bug that they do not land on it especially when the heli is still selected. Try hard to fix that issues it is not so easy as it seems!
