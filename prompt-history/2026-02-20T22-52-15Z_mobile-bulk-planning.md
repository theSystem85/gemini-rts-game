## Prompt
On mobile also support the bulk planning mode for buildings that is triggered on desktop by shift + click build button an then clicking 2 spots on the map to draw a line of buildings between these points. On mobile the analog should be like this: 1) user taps build button and waits till construction is ready then taps again on that button for placing building mode 2) taps on map tile x and holds down => planning overlay gets visible but building is not build until tap is released 3) user  drags on the map to draw consecutive planning mode overlay on all these tiles 4) player releases tap => planned buildings get build in drawn order (similar to desktop implementation) 5) when released ensure to show the updated bulk production number on the build button until bulk is finished
