On iOS when I use the pwa then pause the gane and wait a few hours after some time the game loses its state and get restarted. Endure that the game does not loose its state by constantly every minute make a temporal savegame that can be resumed anytime later. Call it lastGame and override it every minute. Ensure the game is loaded automatically when the pwa was resumed after a game was paused and lost its state. Also automatically save the game on pause.
