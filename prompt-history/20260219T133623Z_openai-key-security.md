## Prompt
"to the "provide open AI key" section of the settings modal add some security critical information that will be shown on hover and when user clicks into the input field for the key.
Add infos like this (but not limited to these):
1) use an special dedicated API key with limited (explain exactly which rights are needed for the game) access rights and quota limit!
2) share information on how this key is used in the game and why and for what
3) add recommendation to use the cheapest model from openAI like the nano versions
4) state that this app does not store the key on our servers and that it lives only in the browsers local storage (which is potentially exposable to XSS attacks) and that we do not grab the key and use it for any other purposes as for this game's AI integration on the users browser.
5) Let the user confirm to enter the key at own risk and that the key is totally optional to play this game
6) put an official openai link on how to setup API keys correctly.

If you have other important ideas to put there feel free to add them!"
