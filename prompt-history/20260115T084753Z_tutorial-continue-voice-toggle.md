When clicking on the minimize button and then clicking on the ? Button to restore the tutorial window then the "continue" button's state gets lost. When it was enabled before after restoration it will never get re-enabled again. Make sure the enabled/disabled state of the continue button does not get lost on minimization!

Also important: Ensure to get the "voice on/off" button back into the tutorial window!
