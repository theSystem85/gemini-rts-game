the way the rockets from the rocket tank behave is still pretty buggy:
1) prevent the rockets from not impacting when they reach an airborne unit (like currently only the apache). Currently the incorrectly just fly and stay under the helicopter and do not explode or make much damage.
2) when I command the rocket tank to attack a target and then move to a position the rocket tank fires at that position instead of going there. when I then command it to fire at a target it is able to fire over extreme long distances incorrectly by ignoring its specified range restrictions.

summary how it should behave correctly when target is selected:
1) units moves to farthest position so it is in specified range for the rockets
2) unit fires the rockets, they go up first (works already) and then fly directly to target direction
3) during flight the rockets do not explode when flying over other enemy units or buildings (because they fly over them)
4) when rockets reach target the immediately explode on the target and make damage on the target
