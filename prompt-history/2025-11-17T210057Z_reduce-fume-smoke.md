Prompt:
I noticed that the performance is drastically reduced when units show the fume animation when damaged heavily like tanks that have less than 25% HP. I guess there are just way too many particles  drawn simultaneously. Make sure to make this specific particle animation more efficient and/or just reduce the number of sprites being drawn to simulate the fume.
