Prompt:
ensure that any resupply can be done symmetrically so for example when an ammo truck is selected that and a tank is clicked then the truck will refill the tanks ammo (already works) BUT when the tank is selected and then the ammo truck is clicked that then the tank drives to the ammo truck to get refilled. Ensure this works also for groups of units and also for all types of supply units like recovery tank, ambulance, tanker truck. Ensure that the cursor turns into the "moveInto" cursor when a unit is selected and the cursor hovers over a supply unit that is able to serve the selected unit. If the selected unit is already serving another unit(s) then the selected unit will be added to the list of units to serve in the beginning (LIFO).
