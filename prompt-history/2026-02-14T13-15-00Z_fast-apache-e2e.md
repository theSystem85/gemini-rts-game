ensure to build the test in a way that it takes as minimum time as possible to finish. Use cheats for spawning the heli and the pad (currently cheats do not support spawning buildings, add this cheats as well, so we can spawn a helipad for the test). So for the test start spawning a helipad, then spawn the heli, then send the heli to the pad to land on it, see it that works, then start the heli and send it to some place near the pad, use ammo cheat to give the just 1 ammo, then spawn an enemy tank, select the heli and attack that tank, then check if the heli attacks the tank, gets back to the pad for refill and if it automatically goes back to the tank when refilled.
