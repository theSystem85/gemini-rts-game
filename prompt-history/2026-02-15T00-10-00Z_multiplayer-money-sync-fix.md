There is currently a bug in human multiplayer mode that (I tried 4 party game with me human host and 2 human players and one AI player) to run a game session and I noticed that during the gameplay the 2 human parties ran out of money even with 2 working harvesters each. I seems that when their harvesters unlaod at the refinery, that they do not get money accounted. Try to find the root cause for that issue and fix it.

Another issue is that when I as a host try to account money to a human party that I get a success notification but the actual human player does not get the money accounted. Fix that as well! This must be a network implementation issue becaue if the party is controlled by AI and it runs locally the party money cheat works!
