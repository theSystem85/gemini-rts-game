Prompt:
ensure all units when moving prevent moving into obstacles before the actually collide with them when in close proximity to an obstacle (use local occupancy map for that) so that they change direction just in time (ensure not to change the actual high level path planning for that for efficiency reasons). Make sure to find an efficient solution to prevent units bouncing into wall or each other. Just some sort of look ahead short path prediction and avoidance!
