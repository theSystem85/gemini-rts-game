Refactor the HUD of a selected unit:
1) the yellow selection outline itself should just be 1px thick
2) the indicator bars for ammo, hp, fuel, load, xp should all be just 3px thick without a border bit with a dark grey background. The selection outline should always go into the center of that 3px.
3) the crew indicator now should go below the bottom bar. The xp indicator itself now becomes that bottom bar.
4) the xp stars go directly over the hp bar but slightly overlapping it by 33%.
5) the entire size of the HUD gets a bit bigger than a tile so that is does not occlude the selected unit itself
