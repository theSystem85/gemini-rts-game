Ensure When user holds any build button for more than a second that a more info and statistics tooltip for that building or unit is shown. Align the design with the tooltip from the money bar.

1) Units
For units show on top a small summary of how many units exist and how much money was spent building each of these units so far (do not count in the restored wrecks of each unit type as well as the repair costs. list those 2 stats separately). Then show a row for each unit with health, fuel, ammo, crew, XP stars and total enemy damage in $ caused by that unit (damage is counted on each hit based on how much hp got destroyed weighted by the units cost in $). Ensure each row can be clicked what yield to the units cost being selected an centered on map. Also show an indicator of what each unit is doing (idle, moving to location, moving to target, attacking, being attacked, being repaired, wrecked (yes also show wrecks in the list at the very bottom). Make sure to get all individual stats in one row by using icons to label the values!

2) buildings
For each building type also show at the very top the name then a description of what it does, cost and power consumption and then the summary in the first row with total count, total cost for production,  total power consumption or production of all users buildings. Then in each following row show individual stats for each building with hp, total damage caused to enemy (if it is a defense building). Also ensure each row is clickable and selects the building + map focus.

Make it all look super professional and aligned with the tooltip design from the money bar!
