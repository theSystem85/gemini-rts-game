Prompt:
in condensed portrait mode ensure
1) the action buttons stack from bottom right to the top (not from right to left!) and only show the icon NOT any background or border (like they do in landscape mode already)
2)the minimap should be exactly looking and working like in landscape mode!
3) the sizes of the build buttons should be the same like in landscape mode
4) the build category tab button should be labeled with tilted letters from top to bottom so no space is wasted on the x axis!
