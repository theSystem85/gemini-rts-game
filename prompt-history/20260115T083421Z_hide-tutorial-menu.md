User prompt:
On desktop and mobile both the minimize button on the tutorial does not make the tutorial menu disappear but I can see the ? Button in the corner popping up correctly. Ensure the tutorial menu gets hidden when the button is clicked! Also handle correctly this warning that comes in the console: "The AudioContext was not allowed to start. It must be resumed (or created) after a user gesture on the page."
