The user was unsatisfied with the code that the agent previously produced, which can be found as the latest commit in the git history.

It works on principle, but there are some issues left to fix. For example, there seem to be two different modes of the planning mode that are active and in concurrent that shouldn't be there. So I described the feature so that when you click on the build button or when you tap on the build button, and then the construction starts, and then you tap again when the construction is ready on the map, you tap and hold on the map, while you draw a path. That path doesn't have to be necessarily a line, it can just be like if you draw with a pencil. And along the drawing path, you will see the planning tiles drawn. And when the tap is released, then the construction or the building, the actual building of the planned tiles start. What is currently implemented is that you only can draw a line, and this is not what I want to have it, at least not in mobile. On desktop, it is fine, you can leave it as it is. And then there is another issue, because when you currently draw the line, I can still see the selection, the yellow selection box. Ensure that in that case, when you are in draw planning mode, there is no selection yellow line. And ensure that doesn't interfere with the selection yellow line, this draw planning mode. Then there is another issue to fix. That is the scrolling, the automated scrolling doing drawing the line in planning mode. It seems to go into the opposite direction. So if I move or draw upwards, it goes downwards. And if I move or draw right-hand side, it goes left-hand side. That needs to be aligned because it should go in the same direction as I draw.
