## Prompt
ensure that all buildings from blue get attacked. Currently it is just the construction yard. There is a refinery and a vehicle factory and a power plant left that also needs to be attacked. Ensure to use AGF (select unit for combat and drag a rect around the entire blue base) so that I can see all targets that shall be attacked when I select the units.

## Requirements Captured
- Ensure all BLUE base structures are included as AGF attack targets (construction yard, refinery, vehicle factory, power plant).
- Use actual AGF interaction semantics (combat unit selection + drag rectangle over BLUE base), not direct command injection.
- Preserve visible AGF target indicators so selected units show all intended targets.
