Ensure the out of range cursor is only shown when a combat unit is selected and the target is out of direct firing range. So when it is out of range show the yellow out of range cursor and when it is inside range show the red attack cursor. Also show a small number inside the out of range cursor that indicates the distance to target (above the cursors center) and the max range of the selected unit (below the cursors center) so that the user can see how far the unit might have to close up when out of range.
