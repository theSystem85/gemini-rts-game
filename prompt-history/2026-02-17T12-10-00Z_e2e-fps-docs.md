- Prompt summary: Optimize multiplayer Playwright E2E runtime and smoothness using official documentation and config/test launch improvements.

## User request
"Do not check my system anymore with scripts. Make the E2E test faster. Search official docs/websites and check test config to get behavior closer to manual 60fps."

## Actions taken
- Reviewed Playwright configuration and multiplayer E2E launch strategy.
- Consulted official Playwright docs (`test-use-options`, `test-configuration`, `browsers`) and Chromium switch reference.
- Updated multiplayer E2E launch behavior to remove uncapped rendering flags by default, cap per-window size, and make channel/uncapped behavior opt-in via environment variables.
- Updated TODO/spec tracking entries to reflect the new performance strategy.
