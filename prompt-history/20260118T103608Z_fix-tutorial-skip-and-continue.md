User prompt:
Skip tutorial button currently does nothing. It should hide the tutorial completely (including the ? Button). Only via a checkbox in the setting menu the tutorial should be made visible again (the styling of that checkboxes is currently ugly see screenshot). Ensure the tutorial can be stepped in both directions. Also ensure the continue button stays disabled until each steps goal is achieved (implemented but does not work correctly always). So there should be the skip forward and backwards buttons plus the continue button that needs to be unlocked in each step. When user unlocks a steps make a nice rewarding animation around the continue button so he can see he was successful.
