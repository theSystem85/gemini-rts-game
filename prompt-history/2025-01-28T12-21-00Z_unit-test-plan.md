## Prompt Summary
Create a unit test plan for comprehensive codebase test coverage and start implementing the first unit test.

## Full Request
> now make a plan of the most important reasonable unit tests that can be made to get some test coverage of the entire codebase. Put the plan into a file so that is can be proceeded interatively with consecutive promps. Start implementing the first and most important unit test immediately after making the unit test plan.

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed the existing codebase structure including:
   - `src/` directory structure (core game logic, AI, rendering, utilities)
   - `tests/` existing setup with `setup.js`, `testUtils.js`, and one integration test
   - `vitest.config.js` test configuration

2. Created comprehensive unit test plan at `tests/UNIT_TEST_PLAN.md` with:
   - 6 priority levels covering all major subsystems
   - Clear status tracking (✅/🔲)
   - Test file naming conventions
   - Implementation notes and conventions
   - Progress tracking table

3. Implemented first unit test: `tests/unit/baseUtils.test.js`
   - 24 tests covering `getBaseStructures()` and `isWithinBaseRange()`
   - Tests for normal cases, edge cases, and error handling
   - All tests passing

## Files Created
- `tests/UNIT_TEST_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive test plan for iterative implementation
- `tests/unit/baseUtils.test.js` - 24 unit tests for base utilities

## Test Results
```
✓ tests/unit/baseUtils.test.js (24 tests) 4ms
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  24 passed (24)
```

## Next Steps (from test plan)
1. Implement `tests/unit/mineSystem.test.js` - Mine system mechanics
2. Implement `tests/unit/pathfinding.test.js` - A* algorithm and caching
3. Implement `tests/unit/unitCombat.test.js` - Combat system
