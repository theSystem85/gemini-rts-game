## User Request
Ensure the cursor switches correctly between out of range cursor and attack cursor when a player's combat unit is selected and the user is hovering over a potential target. This should be already implemented but it is not working correctly because I either only see the one or the other cursor independent of the actual distance to the target and the firing range of the selected unit. Also ensure the distance to the target is shown as a text inside the cursor in black color. The distance is shown in meters. For conversion use 10m per tile (also document this info in the games global specs). Below the distance to target show another number that is the actual range of the selected unit.
