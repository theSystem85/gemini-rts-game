User Prompt:
when I command a serviceable unit to be served by another unit (like a howitzer by an ambulance) what happens is that the howitzer moves to the ambulance's position and the ambulance to the howitzer's BUT they never reach each other because they just exchange their positions and never get in service range. So ensure that when I command a unit to be served that it just stays where it is and does not move to the service unit but always the service unit move to the serviceable unit. also Ensure that when any service unit is selected and a red box is dragged around a group of serviceable units that all units are added to the service units (ammo truck, recovery tank (works already), ambulance, tanker truck) chain of commands!
