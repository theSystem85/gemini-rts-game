User Prompt:
implement a map editor mode where the user can build/change maps by drawing all kind of map tiles on the map when clicking and holding the left mouse cursor. The the current chosen tile type will be drawn on the map (it replaces the current tile there). The user can choose between a specific land tile like grass or in random mode it can automatically choose random grass tile. Below the cursor show the current selected tile type (that image moves with the cursor). When random mode is on and a grass tile is selected and the user draws on the map any random grass tile will be used (similar for any other type of tile like rock, water, street, decoration). put an "edit mode" button into the map section of the sidebar. It is also possible to build base buildings on the map and units but the random mode will not apply there. when in map edit mode the game is always paused so when the play button is pressed the map edit mode is automatically ended. A map can be saved and loaded as just a normal save game. Only the host can edit a map and only before any human player has joined the game. After that the edit mode is locked (button disabled). In edit mode when the user scrolls the mouse wheel the tile to draw is changed instantly so the preview tile image below the cursor updates instantly the the new current tile. Units and buildings during edit mode can be selected from the build bar as normal but can be drawn in the same way on the map when edit map mode is on (no need for the build wait time (that is disabled)). When the user holds shift and left click + hold and drags there will be a box that will be filled on release with the selected current tile type. Make sure the occupancy map in edit mode is constantly updated. the right mouse button can also be used to draw but it will always draw random grass tile (acts like an eraser). add a cheat code for changing the party of the current player (also works in non map edit mode). When base buildings or units are drawn in map edit mode they will automatically belong the the party the host player is assigned to.
