on the edges between water and land tiles (including SOT edges) ensure there is a 6 pixel gradient that fades in the land tile into the water tile so the land gradient grows into the water tile. Also ensure  that below the water tile there is the sand (sand01.jpg) image so the water image asset sits upon it and has about 80% opacity over the sand image. Ensure when the camera moves (user scrolls over the map) there is a litte parallax effect that indicates the distance between the sand (ground) image and the water surface image on top of it. Ensure the parallax water/sand rendering feature as well as the water edges transparent gradient can each be toggled in settings via a checkbox.
