User request:
- there must be an issue with the sound playback of moving units (I tested tank_v1) because it seems that the movement sound currently NEVER stops at all!
- Find the root cause for the problem and fix it!
- Ensure the same movement sound is not played multiple times by the same unit (prevent overlapping/loud stacking).
