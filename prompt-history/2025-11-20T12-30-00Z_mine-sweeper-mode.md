Prompt:
I expect the mine sweeper tank to go into mine clearance mode and systematically cleara the area from mines when the unit is selected and the user drag a rect on the map. Then the unit will go to the first tile on the rect and before entering that tile it will go into clearance mode and become 70% slower and produce dust to indicate the mode is active. Then the unit drives over every tile of the marked filed in a systematic patter (left to right, top to bottom) or the other way round depending on from where the sweeper comes from and what is shorter. See the spec for more detail. Currently nothing of that works but it might be implemented to some degree.
