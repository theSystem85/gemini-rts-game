## Prompt

write a professional readme and put the old one into a legacy version of it. The new readme should:
1) describe what the purpose of this game is (started as a benchmark for LLM to 0 shot a complex RTS game and turned into an RTS game that can use LLMs to control the AI players with the goal to offer an inbuild user friendly programming feature to automate the AI of the players units (TBD)). Mention that the game is fully vibe coded and started in December 2024.
2) how to install and run it locally
3) reference the user docs on how to play the game
4) reference the docs of the game architecture
