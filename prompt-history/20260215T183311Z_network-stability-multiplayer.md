## Prompt
Analyse why the network stability in a multiplayer match with human player could be unstable and propose and implement measures on how to improve the connectivity. One step is to pause the game when any client is not responsive and wait for that client to reconnect before letting the ai take his party over! If that happens show the time of unresponsiveness with a timer to all clients and the host until connection is resumed! Create also a comprehensive Documentation file with diagrams (mermaid) on how the network implementation works after your improvements! Also check and ensure that any constellation of ai and human players can work in a match with 2-4 players.
