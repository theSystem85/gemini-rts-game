## Prompt
in tests/lighthouse folder there lives the current performance report you have to analyse. Make a weighted list of the top 10 todos on how to improve the performance metrics of the lighthouse score! in the specs folder create tasks for each of the 10 todos so that I can have agents work on them independently. Make sure each spec has enough information for each coding agent (using codex from openai) to solve the task!
