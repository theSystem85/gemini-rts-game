## User Request

In the map settings on the players section:
1) Do not show the label of the color but just the colored dot itself.
2) Instead of "Human (Host)" show "You (Host)"
3) Make sure that there is an input field where every party can enter an alias name which is automatically used when a multiplayer session is joined and persisted on localStorage so you only have to enter it once either in the players section input or on the modal when joining the game. In both cases it is synced and persisted. The label of the input is "Your alias: "

## Changes Made

### 1. `src/ui/sidebarMultiplayer.js`

- Added `PLAYER_ALIAS_STORAGE_KEY` constant for localStorage persistence
- Added `getStoredPlayerAlias()` export function to read alias from localStorage
- Added `setStoredPlayerAlias()` export function to save alias to localStorage
- Added `setupAliasInput()` function to initialize and sync the alias input
- Updated `createPartyRow()` to show only owner text (not "Color: Owner" format)
- Added tooltip to the color dot with the party color name

### 2. `src/ui/remoteInviteLanding.js`

- Imported `getStoredPlayerAlias` and `setStoredPlayerAlias` from sidebarMultiplayer
- Pre-fill the alias input with stored value when join modal opens
- Added input event listener to sync alias changes to localStorage and sidebar input

### 3. `src/network/multiplayerStore.js`

- Changed "Human (Host)" to "You (Host)" in `ensurePartyStates()` function

### 4. `src/ui/remoteInviteLanding.js` (convertToStandaloneHost)

- Changed "Human (Host)" to "You (Host)" when kicked client becomes standalone host

### 5. `index.html`

- Added "Your alias:" input field below the Players input in map settings

## Summary

- Party list now shows just the colored dot (with tooltip showing "Green", "Red", etc.) followed by the owner status
- Host's own party shows "You (Host)" instead of "Human (Host)"
- New alias input in map settings persists to localStorage under key `rts-player-alias`
- Alias is synced bidirectionally between the sidebar input and the remote join modal input
- When joining a game, the stored alias is automatically pre-filled
