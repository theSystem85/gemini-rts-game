## Prompt
- Continue stabilization and get multiplayer E2E to pass while preserving window/content alignment, strict host pause-before-resume flow, and per-party refinery income validation.

## Actions
- Fixed paused-frame networking deadlock by running `updateGame(0, ...)` in paused frames and moving remote-command processing before pause early return in `updateGame`.
- Corrected economy assertion source to use `factories` from `/src/main.js` (authoritative per-party budgets) instead of `gameState.factories`.
- Reworked income wait into explicit polling with imports for reliable HOST/RED/YELLOW budget/money deltas.
- Adjusted multiplayer E2E timeout to accommodate full visible build progression plus unload-income cycle.
- Re-ran lint and multiplayer E2E to green.
