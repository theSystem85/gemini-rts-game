Prompt:
it still does not start to sweep the mine field. The unit does not even go there. Ensure it goes there and start to sweep. It is not important if there are actually mines in the marked area and to whom they belong. The mine sweeper tank just needs to go there and slowly sweep the entire field.

Also ensure when the entire field was cleared that AllMinesOnTheFieldAreDisarmed.mp3 will be played AND The_mine_field_has_been_deployed_and_armed.mp3 when a mine layer truck has deployed an entire mine field.
