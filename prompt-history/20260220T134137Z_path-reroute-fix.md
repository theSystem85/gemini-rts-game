## Prompt

find out why the path finding algorithm is constantly rerouting and ensure it does not do that anymore!!! Find the root cause, analyse all functions that take into play when a ground unit moves from a to b and why it could happen that after initial path planning some re-routing happens. Ensure units move locally around moving obstacles without giving up the entire planned route! Make sure to come up with a solid solution that takes units quickly from A to B. I also want to see in the path planning visualisation when the unit does local evading of obstacles. when that happens replace the part of the path that is done for the evasion of the obstacle and color that fragment in blue lines instead of the current orange ones so I can see why and when evading should be done and planned path will be continued!
