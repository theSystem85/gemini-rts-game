User requested: "ok the problem is in the sweeping algorithm. the unit does not drive to the tiles in the area but somehow remotely disarmes all mines in the field when arriving at the field somewhere. Make sure the sweeper has to drive over each mine in order to disarm it and trigger its explosion (that does not harm the sweeper when in sweeping mode)"
