LLM: codex

ensure the LLM AI when controlling the enemy and commenting on the scene is aware of who owns which buildings and units. Currently it comments incorrectly on me destroying its buildings like they were mine. Update the default system LLM prompt so it needs to differentiate all available parties units and buildings and comment accordingly. It especially has to know which party itself it is controlling!
