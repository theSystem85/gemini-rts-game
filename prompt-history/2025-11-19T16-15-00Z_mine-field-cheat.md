Model: GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini (Preview)

- Prompt: add a cheat code so `mines 2x3g1` drops a field (2×3 with 1-tile gaps) and `3x1`/`3x1g0` gives three in a row.
- Ensure the patterned command is recognized with or without the `mines` prefix, supports optional gap (`g`), and respects owner targeting.
- Reminder: update TODO.md, relevant specs, and record the prompt per AGENTS instructions.
