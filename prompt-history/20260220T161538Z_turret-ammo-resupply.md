## Prompt
The user was unsatisfied with the previous rocket-turret spawn fix and requested: align rocket-turret muzzle flash with the six spawn points; add turret ammo bars + red 1px reload indicators; enforce ammo/reload logistics for rocket/artillery/turretGun V1-V3 (4x relevant unit ammo capacities); make ammo trucks auto-target empty rocket turrets for resupply; add bidirectional move-into cursor + click-to-resupply interactions between selected turret and ammo truck (and vice versa); and apply the same refill/ammo mechanism across listed turret types.
