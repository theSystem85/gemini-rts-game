Ensure that when display is in portrait but not in pwa full screen mode that the energy and power bar is at the right side of the building bar after the buildings/units toggle. There it should grow from bottom to top of 100% height of the sidebar. Ensure the height of the sidebar does not increase. Make both bar as wide as the buildings/units tab toggle button. Show the values in 90deg tilted text on top of each bar centered. Ensure these changes do not affect the power and energy bars of other display modes, only non pwa portrait with condensed sidebar!! Make it look good an professional!
