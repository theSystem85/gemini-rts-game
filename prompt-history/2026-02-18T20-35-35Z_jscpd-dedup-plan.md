## Prompt
I now switched to use jscpd to monitor the code redundancy so create a new plan on how to tackle the findings from there: report/html/index.html

Fix all duplications mentioned in the report were it makes sense!

## Notes
- Source of truth switched from jsinspect to jscpd report artifacts.
- Requested a new actionable plan and implementation against report findings.
