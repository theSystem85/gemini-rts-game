on desktop ensure that the map scrolls automatically when user leaves the cursor for more than 250ms in the 5% of width/height of the maps edges. Ensure the speed of the autoscrolling is configurable in config editor. Ensure that the speed get little multiplied the the more it is closer to each edge but the effect does not kick in before it is at least in the 5% range of the screen edge. So if the screen was 100px the first and last 5px of the screen to the left and right would start to trigger the auto scroll effect. Ensure the user can also completely disable autoscroll via checkmark in the settings.
