# Turret Image Rendering Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented rotating turret system with separate base and top images for turretGunV1, similar to the tank rendering system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ **Static Base, Rotating Top**
- `turret01_base.webp` - Static base rendered at building center
- `turret01_top.webp` - Rotating top that aims at targets
- Both images maintain original aspect ratios and proportions

### 2. ✅ **Smooth Turret Rotation**
- Uses same rotation speed as tanks (`TANK_TURRET_ROT = 0.08` radians per frame)
- Smooth rotation using `smoothRotateTowardsAngle()` function from tank system
- **Continuous tracking**: Turret rotates every frame when enemies are in range
- **Smart firing**: Only fires when properly aligned with target (±5.7° tolerance)

### 3. ✅ **Accurate Targeting**
- Turrets track enemies continuously, not just when firing
- Only fire when aligned within 0.1 radian tolerance
- **Initial aiming**: New turrets face towards nearest enemy base when built
- **Fixed rotation offset**: Corrected 180-degree aiming issue

### 4. ✅ **Muzzle Flash Positioning**
- Flash spawns at `(31x, 0y)` coordinates relative to top-left of `turret01_top.webp`
- Flash follows turret rotation correctly
- Uses same visual style as tank muzzle flashes (radial gradient, fade effect)

### 5. ✅ **Toggle System**
- **R key** toggles between image-based and legacy rendering
- **T key** still toggles tank image rendering (unchanged)
- State persists in save games
- Visual feedback with notification messages

### 6. ✅ **Fallback Rendering**
- If turret images fail to load, automatically uses original line-based rendering
- If toggle is disabled, uses base image for building + legacy turret rendering
- Maintains full compatibility with existing game mechanics

## Recent Fixes Applied

### ✅ **Rotation Direction Fix**
- Fixed 180-degree offset by adjusting image rotation to `turretDirection + π/2`
- Turret now aims correctly at targets instead of away from them
- Muzzle flash positioning remains accurate

### ✅ **Continuous Tracking**
- Separated rotation logic from firing logic
- Turrets now track enemies every frame, providing smooth rotation
- More realistic behavior - turrets rotate to face threats even when not firing

### ✅ **Smart Firing Logic**
- Turrets only fire when properly aligned with target (±5.7° tolerance)
- No more firing while still rotating to target
- Improved accuracy and realism

### ✅ **Initial Direction**
- New turrets automatically face towards nearest enemy base when built
- Provides tactical advantage and realistic behavior
- Uses player position data to determine enemy base locations

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/turretImageConfig.json` - Configuration for turret image assets
- `src/rendering/turretImageRenderer.js` - Image-based turret rendering system

### Modified Files:
- `src/rendering/buildingRenderer.js` - Updated to use new turret renderer
- `src/game/buildingSystem.js` - Added continuous turret tracking and smart firing
- `src/buildings.js` - Added initial turret direction calculation
- `src/gameSetup.js` - Added turret image preloading
- `src/gameState.js` - Added `useTurretImages` toggle
- `src/input/keyboardHandler.js` - Added R key toggle
- `src/saveGame.js` - Added turret toggle to save state
- `src/buildingImageMap.js` - Updated turretGunV1 to use base image fallback

## Asset Requirements
- ✅ `public/images/map/buildings/turret01_base.webp` - Static base
- ✅ `public/images/map/buildings/turret01_top.webp` - Rotating top
- Both images face downward by default (same as tank assets)

## Usage
1. Start the game (turret images enabled by default)
2. Build a Turret Gun V1 (`turretGunV1`) - it will face nearest enemy base
3. Turret will continuously track and smoothly rotate to follow enemy units
4. Turret only fires when properly aligned with target
5. Press **R** to toggle between image-based and legacy rendering
6. Muzzle flash appears at correct position when turret fires

## Technical Notes
- Turret rotation uses same mechanics as tank turrets
- Images are preloaded at game startup for performance
- No recoil effect implemented (as requested)
- Rate of turn (ROT) matches tank turret speed
- Flash animation duration and style match existing effects
- Rotation direction corrected with +π/2 offset for proper image orientation

## Testing
- Server running on http://localhost:5175/
- Ready for testing turret placement, rotation, and firing
- Toggle functionality ready for verification
- Aiming accuracy and firing behavior improved
